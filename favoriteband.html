        countries.[1] Their following studio album Meteora continued the band's success, topping the Billboard 200 album chart in 2003, and was followed by extensive touring and charity work around the world.[2] In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth-greatest
        band of the music video era and the third-best of the new millennium.[3] Billboard ranked Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade chart.[4] In 2012, the band was voted as the greatest artist of the 2000s in a Bracket Madness poll
        on VH1.[5] In 2014, the band was declared as the Biggest Rock Band in the World Right Now by Kerrang!.[6][7] Having adapted nu metal and rap metal to a radio-friendly yet densely layered style in Hybrid Theory and Meteora,[8][9][10] the band explored
        other genres in their next studio album, Minutes to Midnight (2007).[11][12] The album topped the Billboard charts and had the third-best debut week of any album that year.[13][14] The band continued to explore a wider variation of musical types
        in their fourth album, A Thousand Suns (2010), layering their music with more electronic sounds and beats. Their fifth album, Living Things (2012), combines musical elements from all of their previous records. Their sixth and most recent album,
        The Hunting Party (2014), returned to a heavier rock sound. The band has collaborated with several other artists, most notably with rapper Jay Z in their mashup EP Collision Course, and many others on the remix albums Reanimation and Recharged.[9]
        Linkin Park has sold over 68 million albums worldwide and has won two Grammy Awards.</p>
